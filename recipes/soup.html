        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>
                    Combine tomatoes, chicken broth, garlic cloves, and a large slice of onion in a stockpot over medium heat. Bring to a boil, and gently simmer for about 20 minutes to blend flavors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove from heat and run the mixture through a food mill into a large bowl, or pan. Discard any stuff left over in the food mill.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Melt butter over medium heat in the now empty stockpot. Stir in flour to make a roux by cooking, whisking constantly, until mixture turns medium brown.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture to prevent lumps from forming, then stir in the rest.
                </li>
                <li>Season with sugar and salt to taste.</li>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
